  abstract    = {We classify and enumerate the idempotents in several planar diagram monoids: namely, the Motzkin, Jones (a.k.a. Temperley–Lieb) and Kauffman monoids. The classification is in terms of certain vertex- and edge-coloured graphs associated to Motzkin diagrams. The enumeration is necessarily algorithmic in nature, and is based on parameters associated to cycle components of these graphs. We compare our algorithms to existing algorithms for enumerating idempotents in arbitrary (regular ⁎-) semigroups, and give several tables of calculated values.},

  abstract      = {This paper introduces Concurrent Valuation Algebras (CVAs), extending ordered valuation algebras (OVAs) by incorporating two combine operators representing parallel and sequential products that adhere to a weak exchange law. CVAs present significant theoretical and practical advantages for specifying and modelling concurrent and distributed systems. As a presheaf on a space of domains, a CVA facilitates localised specifications, promoting modularity, compositionality, and the capability to represent large and complex systems. Moreover, CVAs facilitate lattice-based refinement reasoning, and are compatible with standard methodologies such as Hoare and Rely-Guarantee logics. We demonstrate the flexibility of CVAs through three trace models that represent distinct paradigms of concurrent/distributed computing, and interrelate them via morphisms. We also discuss the potential for importing a powerful local computation framework from valuation algebras for the model checking of concurrent and distributed systems.},

  abstract    = {We present a lattice of distributed program specifications, whose ordering represents implementability/refinement. Specifications are modelled by families of subsets of relative execution traces, which encode the local orderings of state transitions, rather than their absolute timing according to a global clock. This is to overcome fundamental physical difficulties with synchronisation. The lattice of specifications is assembled and analysed with several established mathematical tools. Sets of nondegenerate cells of a simplicial set are used to model relative traces, presheaves model the parametrisation of these traces by a topological space of variables, and information algebras reveal novel constraints on program correctness. The latter aspect brings the enterprise of program specification under the widening umbrella of contextual semantics introduced by Abramsky et al. In this model of program specifications, contextuality manifests as a failure of a consistency criterion comparable to Lamport's definition of sequential consistency. The theory of information algebras also suggests efficient local computation algorithms for the verification of this criterion. The novel constructions in this paper have been verified in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL.},

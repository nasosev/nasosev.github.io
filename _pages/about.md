I am the founder of [Oneironaut](https://oneironaut.dev), a consultancy startup specialising in the creation of mathematical software that harnesses the potential of category theory, functional programming, and machine learning. Concurrently, I am in my third year of doctoral study at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), where I am intensely focused on exploring the application of sheaf theory to distributed systems as well as to knowledge representation and reasoning. Through my dual roles in academia and industry, I am uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between theoretical innovation and practical application, creating solutions that are both mathematically sound and directly applicable to real-world problems.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

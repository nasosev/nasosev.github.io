I am the founder of [Oneironaut](https://oneironaut.dev), a pioneering consultancy startup that focuses on the development of mathematical software by leveraging the power of category theory, functional programming, and machine learning. Parallel to my entrepreneurial pursuits, I am currently immersed in my third year of doctoral research at The University of Queensland's School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). My academic exploration centres around the application of sheaf theory to distributed systems and its potential for knowledge representation and reasoning. These combined roles in academia and industry uniquely equip me to bridge the divide between theoretical advancements and their practical application. My passion lies in formulating mathematically robust solutions that can be deployed to tackle real-world challenges.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
